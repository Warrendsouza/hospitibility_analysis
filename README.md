Hospitality Data Analytics Dashboard
*Tools: Power BI, Excel*

Project Overview:
I designed and developed an advanced **hospitality data analytics dashboard** aimed at delivering actionable insights into revenue and occupancy trends. This project leverages real-world hotel operations, providing clear and comprehensive analytics for a fictional hotel chain, **Atle GRS**. Through careful data modeling and visualization in **Power BI**, I transformed complex data into intuitive, business-focused insights.

#### **Key Metrics Implemented:**
- **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR):** A key industry metric used to evaluate how effectively a hotel manages its room inventory. Calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of available rooms, RevPAR provides a direct measure of profitability.
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** This metric calculates the average revenue earned from each occupied room, providing a clear view of pricing efficiency.
- **Occupancy Rates:** A percentage that shows how many rooms were occupied compared to the total number of available rooms, highlighting utilization rates.

#### **Project Highlights:**
- Created a **dynamic dashboard** featuring critical KPIs such as total revenue, occupancy percentage, and weekly revenue trends, offering stakeholders a clear and actionable overview of hotel performance.
- Implemented **interactive filters** for city, booking status, and booking platform, allowing for granular data analysis across various business dimensions.
- Ensured the integration of critical metrics such as **RevPAR** and **ADR**, offering management a detailed understanding of how room pricing and occupancy impact overall revenue.
- Executed the entire data analytics project lifecycle, from **data gathering** and **transformation** to **visualization** and **stakeholder feedback**. This approach ensured that the final deliverable aligned with the strategic goals of the business.
- Delivered an **interactive real-time report**, empowering business managers with data-driven insights to enhance decision-making, improve pricing strategies, and drive competitive advantage.
